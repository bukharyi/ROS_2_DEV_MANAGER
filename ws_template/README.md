# NOTE
Workspace for robot specific launch files, node files and parameter files. If you are developing a package using this robot as test platform, it is recommended to create a new workspace instead.

## Creating new workspace
You can create a new workspace by simply create a new folder in the project directory with prefix `ws_` (eg: `ws_dev1`). Then create an alias (Refer to development manager for info on how to create an alias).
